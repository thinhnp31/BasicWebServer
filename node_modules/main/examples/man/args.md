# demo.js -- A demonstration of the features & formatting

## SYNOPSIS

sample [flags] `<first>` `<last>` `[pet]`

## OPTIONS

### -f, --flag
This is a boolean flag as there is no values that follow the flag. It can be accessed with $('f') or $('flag')

### --anything ANYTHING
This flag expects a value to come after it. It can be a number, a string, etc. The type will be auto detected and the value of $('anything') will be that value.

### -s "VALUE" --string "VALUE"
Same as above, except that the value placeholder is in quotes meaning that no type detection is performed, and it is kept as a string. Give it `000123` and it will remain `000123` vs. converting it to a number resulting in `123`.

### --default=SOMETHING -d SOMETHING (default=foo)
It is also possible to set default values.

### --home (default=$HOME)
And use environment variables to set those defaults. Any default value beginning with a `$` will be treated as an environment variable.
